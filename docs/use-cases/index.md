# Use Cases

LangGuard helps security and compliance teams gain visibility into AI operations across the organization. Here's how teams use LangGuard to address common AI security challenges.

## Security & Threat Detection

<div className="homepage-features">

### [Detect Prompt Injection](/use-cases/prompt-injection)
Identify malicious prompts targeting your AI systems, correlate with user and session context, and enforce policies to block or alert on violations.

### [Identify Data Exfiltration](/use-cases/data-exfiltration)
Detect sensitive data being sent to AI services, trace it back to source endpoints or users, and trigger incident response workflows.

</div>

## Governance & Compliance

<div className="homepage-features">

### [Monitor AI Coding Assistants](/use-cases/coding-assistants)
See high-risk code suggestions and policy violations from tools like Claude Code or Cursor, alert your security team, and provide context for SOC analyst review.

### [Track Shadow AI Usage](/use-cases/shadow-ai)
Identify unauthorized AI tools and API calls across endpoints and cloud environments, assess risk, and enforce governance policies.

</div>

## Why LangGuard?

### Unified Visibility

Most organizations use multiple AI tools and platforms. LangGuard aggregates data from all your observability sources into a single view, eliminating blind spots.

### Policy-Based Automation

Define policies once and apply them consistently across all AI interactions. Automatically detect violations without manual review of every trace.

### Security-First Design

Built for security teams, not just developers. LangGuard provides the context and workflow integration that SOC analysts need to investigate and respond to AI-related incidents.
